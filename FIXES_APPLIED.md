# Issues Found and Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing `metadata` Column in `chat_history` Table
**Error:** `PGRST204: Could not find the 'metadata' column of 'chat_history' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause:** The database schema was missing the `metadata` column in the `chat_history` table, but the application code was trying to insert data into this column.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'` column to the migration script in `sql/FINAL_MIGRATION.sql`
- Created a separate migration script `sql/add_metadata_column.sql` for immediate deployment

### 2. Temporary File Usage in Upload Script
**Issue:** The upload script `upload_documents.sh` was using `/tmp/upload_response.json` for temporary storage.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed temporary file usage
- Modified script to handle response directly in memory using shell variables
- Updated response parsing to avoid file system dependencies

### 3. Missing Document Upload Support in Telegram Bot
**Issue:** The Telegram bot only handled text and voice messages, but not document uploads.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `message.document` handling in `src/telegram_bot.py`
- Implemented `_handle_document_message()` method with:
  - PDF file type validation
  - File size limits (20MB)
  - Document processing through the existing pipeline
  - Bilingual user feedback (Hindi/English)
  - Analytics logging

### 4. Documents Not Stored in Supabase Storage
**Issue:** Document chunks were being stored in the database, but the original PDF files were not being uploaded to Supabase storage bucket.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `src/document_processor.py` to upload documents to Supabase storage as the first step
- Updated `_generate_chunk_embeddings()` to include storage URL in chunk metadata
- Enhanced database storage to properly handle storage URLs from chunks

## Files Modified

1. **sql/FINAL_MIGRATION.sql** - Added metadata column to chat_history table
2. **sql/add_metadata_column.sql** - New migration script for immediate deployment
3. **upload_documents.sh** - Removed temporary file usage
4. **src/telegram_bot.py** - Added document upload handling
5. **src/document_processor.py** - Added storage upload and enhanced metadata handling
6. **src/database.py** - Enhanced chunk storage to handle storage URLs properly

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run the metadata column migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute in Supabase SQL editor
   \i sql/add_metadata_column.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the column was added:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'chat_history' 
   AND column_name = 'metadata';
   ```

3. **Deploy the updated application code**

4. **Test document upload via Telegram bot**

## Expected Results After Fixes

1. ✅ Chat history storage will work without PGRST204 errors
2. ✅ Upload scripts will work without temporary files
3. ✅ Users can upload PDF documents via Telegram bot
4. ✅ Documents will be stored in Supabase storage bucket
5. ✅ Document processing logs will show successful operations
6. ✅ Chat history will properly store conversation metadata

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if documents are in storage bucket
# (Check Supabase dashboard -> Storage -> your bucket)

# Check document processing logs
SELECT * FROM document_processing_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# Check chat history with metadata
SELECT id, role, content, metadata, created_at 
FROM chat_history 
WHERE metadata IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Check documents table for storage URLs
SELECT source_document, metadata->>'storage_url' as storage_url, created_at 
FROM documents 
WHERE metadata->>'storage_url' IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```
